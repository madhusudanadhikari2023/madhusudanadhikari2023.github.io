I have completed my Masters in Computer Science and IT from Institute of Science and Technology, Tribhuvan University and Masters in Material Science and Engineering from, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University. My primary area of interest is application of computer science in materials science research. In lab-based experiments, I am interested in synthesis of nano particles and nano fibres for photocatalytic activities. During my Masters in Materials Science, I synthesized cobalt and cerium co-doped nanoparticles for antimicrobial and photocatalytic purposes. Now I am looking into PhD opportunities where I can uitlize my knowledge of these areas where I worked.
